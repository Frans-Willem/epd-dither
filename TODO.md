- Documentation: Update example images with new brute-force decomposer approach
- Documentation: Explain difference between noise sources (e.g. white, blue, bayer, interleaved gradient)
- Documentation: Explain decomposition methods
- Documentation: Explain how most colors have at least 3 possible decompositions with 4 colors, and infinite possibilities with 4+ colors.
- Code: Implement Floyd-Steinberg (and other error diffusion) using the decomposed colors
- Code: Implement palette options (both dither and output palette)
- Code: Allow Floyd-Steinberg on RGB or decomposed (e.g. have dither-rgb and dither-decompose)
- Code: Put "alloc" behind a feature, such that DecomposeBruteforce is disabled (as it needs Vec)
